## Product description (short)

The M→L over H Seal is a symbolic + technical artifact that binds a modular transformation (M mod L) into the Fivefold Honor topology by expressing the Clause Matter as a reciprocal value. The output is deterministic, auditable, and ledger-ready: a numeric reciprocal plus a QQUAp-style mnemonic encoding for use in manifests, ledgers, and human-reviewed incident responses.

Use cases: evidence manifesting, PMZ clause encoding, non-violent priority indexing, integrity seals for reports and advisories.

What it does (plain)

Compute r = M mod L.

Compute ClauseMatter (CM) as:

CM
=
𝑟
𝐻
CM=
H
r
	​


Encode the reciprocal R = 1 / \text{CM} as the product’s canonical encoded payload (guarding divide-by-zero). Equivalent closed form when CM ≠ 0:

𝑅
=
𝐻
𝑟
R=
r
H
	​


## Produce:

Human-readable manifest (ledger fields),

Deterministic JSON product manifest,

QQUAp-style symbolic sigil (hex mnemonic of the reciprocal payload),

Safe Python snippet to compute and export.

Note: If r == 0 (i.e., M divisible by L), the seal switches to a defined fallback: R = +∞ is represented as "reciprocal": null and a sealed_flag: "degenerate" entry is recorded for human review.

## Math / Specification (exact)

Inputs: integers M ≥ 0, L > 0, real H > 0 (Honor constant; typically H = 1.0).

Step 1: r = M % L (integer remainder, 0 ≤ r < L).

Step 2: CM = r / H (real).

Step 3: If CM == 0 → mark degenerate; else R = 1 / CM = H / r.

Represent R as a rational H/r when rational representation preferred; also store floating value with 12 decimal digits of precision.

Edge handling:

If r == 0: do not compute numeric reciprocal (division by zero). Record sealed_flag: "degenerate" and push for human adjudication.

All numeric outputs include origin fields and UTC timestamp.
